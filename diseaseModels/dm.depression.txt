title
Depression Disease Model
  
description
This is a disease model for depression.
Lifetime risk depends on sex, being twice as high in females as males.
The age of onset curve doesn't differ between the sexes.
This model is based on a model for Major Depression justified in Campbell et al. 2010.
It differs from that model in that the Campbell et al. model had sex specific age of onset curves.
However the male and female age of onset curves were similar and have been merged here.
