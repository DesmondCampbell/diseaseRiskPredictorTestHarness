7. Non-Congenital Disease with Lifetime Risk dependent on sex and pgs
       
description     
This is the Major Depression disease model again. 
However a quantitative risk factor 'pgs' has been added to the model. 
'pgs' is wholely genetic. It could be a polygenic risk score derived from GWAS study results. 
'pgs' is assumed to be have a population mean of 0 and std dev of 1. 
Given this and disease liability having a std dev of 1, the regression coeff of 0.32 implies that pgs explains 10% of liability variance. 
droppedRiskFactors - You can drop both sex and pgs from being risk factors by uncommenting the droppedRiskFactors heading.
