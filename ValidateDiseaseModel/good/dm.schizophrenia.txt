Schizophrenia Disease Model
  
description
This is a disease model for schizophrenia.
For Schizophrenia lifetime risk is the same for males and females.
However age of onset differs between males and females, being typically early 20s for males, late 20s for females.
Sources
The partitioning of liability variance comes from 
- Sullivan, Kendler, Neale. 2003. Schizophrenia as a complex trait: evidence from a meta-analysis of twin studies.
Other parts come from just general knowledge.
Caveats
The relative risk estimates the model produces are a bit high compared to Gottesman 1991, see http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/hereditygen.htm
However when lifetime risk is reduced to 0.5% they match alot better.
Sullivan, Kendler, Neale. 2003. based their ACE model on a meta-analysis of twin studies, in when there was heterogeneity across studies of lifetime risk.
They said this didn't impact on their estimation of how variance was partitioned.
